crate - library/package synonym.

each crate has an implicit root module (in lib.rs or main.rs)
crate can have an ierarchy of submodules.

Sub-modules in separate files:
modules can be declared as 'mod modname;', Rusr will expect to find either
 * modname.rs file near or
 * modname/mod.rs

Note: in these files mod declaration is not needed, it's already been done on includer's side

To make'em accessible using 'extern crate modname', modules need to be declared public, 'pub mod modname;'
if crate name uses dashes ('uses-dashes'), they'll be automatically converted to underscores ('uses_dashes').

By default Cargo assumes main.rs a root crate (not lib.rs).
Having both main.rs and lib.rs is common for executable crates.
